# Threshold Network

The [Threshold Network](https://threshold.network) empowers users to utilize novel, strange, and straightforward threshold cryptography,
run in a Byzantine-fault tolerant fashion by nodes which execute the logic of this repository.

Threshold is not a single application, but the synergy of several; its origins are in the
[first ever on-chain merge of two open-source protocols](https://blog.threshold.network/threshold-launch/).

Since these applications are maintained by different teams, in different respositories,
written in different languages, this respository contains only the tooling to ensure that
they can be run harmoniously and contemporanouesly on a common fleet of nodes.
