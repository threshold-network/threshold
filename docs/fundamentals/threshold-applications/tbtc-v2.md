Existing solutions that bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum require users to send their Bitcoin to an intermediary, in exchange for an Ethereum token that represents the original asset. This centralized model requires you to trust a third party and is prone to censorship, threatening Bitcoin's promise of secure, permissionless decentralization.

The second generation of tBTC ([tBTC v2](https://blog.threshold.network/tbtc-v2-vision-for-2022/)) **** is a truly decentralized bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum. It provides Bitcoin holders secure and open access to the broader cryptoeconomy. tBTC v2 allows you to unlock your Bitcoin’s value to borrow and lend, mint stablecoins, provide liquidity, and much more.

Instead of centralized intermediaries, tBTC v2 uses a randomly selected group of operators running nodes on the Threshold Network to secure deposited Bitcoin through threshold cryptography. That means tBTC v2 requires a threshold majority agreement before operators perform any action with your Bitcoin. By rotating the selection of operators weekly, tBTC v2 protects against any individual or group of operators seizing control. Unlike other solutions on the market, users of tBTC v2 trust math, not hardware or people.
