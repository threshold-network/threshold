# Upgrade NU / KEEP to T

NU and KEEP tokens can be upgraded to T tokens via the Vending Machine contracts. \
\
As decided by the NU and KEEP communities in the [final merge proposal](https://forum.keep.network/t/t-token-proposal-rc0/264), the conversion ratio for each token is based on the total supply rather than price. The final total supply of NU is \~1,380,688,920 and the total supply of KEEP is \~940,795,010.&#x20;

As a result, the token factors are:

* 1 NU: \~3.26 T
* 1 KEEP: \~4.78 T

Token upgrades can be performed via the [Threshold Dashboard](https://dashboard.threshold.network/upgrade) which interfaces directly with the Vending Machine smart contracts.
