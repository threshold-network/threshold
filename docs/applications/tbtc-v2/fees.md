# Fees

tBTC fees are action-based (i.e. users incur a mint and redemption fee when using the bridge). Currently, the mint fee is [0% ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5e4861a80B55f035D899f66772117F00FA0E8e7B#readProxyContract#F3)and the redemption fee is [0.2%](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5e4861a80B55f035D899f66772117F00FA0E8e7B#readProxyContract#F13). The bridge fees can be changed through governance.
