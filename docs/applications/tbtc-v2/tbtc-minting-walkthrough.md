# tBTC Minting Walkthrough

## Before you start

Here are some things you will need before you start the minting process:

:white\_check\_mark: Bitcoin (BTC)

:white\_check\_mark: Ethereum (ETH) for Ethereum transaction gas costs

:white\_check\_mark: Bitcoin compatible wallet

:white\_check\_mark: Ethereum compatible wallet\


If you don't already have one, you'll need to set up a Bitcoin wallet. A solid option to use is Green Wallet. You can download it here:

* [Apple store download](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/green-bitcoin-wallet/id1402243590)
* [Google store download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greenaddress.greenbits\_android\_wallet\&gl=US\&pli=1)

After you've created your wallet, select `Bitcoin` as your network.



## Start minting tBTC

:tada: _You're ready to mint! Go to the tBTC dapp here:_ [_https://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC/mint_](https://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC/mint)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have questions about terminology, you can toggle over to the **How it Works** page in the dapp to learn more. You can also dive into documentation on [wallet generation](https://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2/wallet-generation) and [bridge permissionlessness](https://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2/the-path-to-permissionlessness) in the docs.
{% endhint %}

### STEP 1: Generate a deposit address

1. Connect your preferred Ethereum wallet to the tBTC dapp by selecting **Connect Wallet**.

4. Make sure to download the JSON file by clicking **Download**. The JSON file contains a wallet public key, a refund public key, and a refund lock time. You need to keep this JSON file until you receive your tBTC tokens.

### STEP 4: tBTC Minting
