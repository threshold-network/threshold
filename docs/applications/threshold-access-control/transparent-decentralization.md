# Use Cases

TACo is relevant to virtually any Web3 app, stack or system that handles private data.&#x20;

TACo's early adopters operate in domains where compromising on trust reduction simply doesn't fly; recovering seed phrases, passing on crypto assets as inheritance, enforcing decryption rights for tokenized legacy media libraries, transferring deployment/SSH keys to remote machines, concealing in-game assets, and a host of other use cases.
