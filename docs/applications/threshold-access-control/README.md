# TACo - Threshold Access Control

**TACo** (**T**hreshold **A**ccess **Co**ntrol) enables end-to-end encrypted data sharing and communication. There is no requirement to trust a centralized authority or entity, who might unilaterally deny service or even (surreptitiously) decrypt private end-user data.&#x20;

It is currently the only access control layer available to Web3 developers is decentralized from genesis, via the live, well-collateralized, and battle-tested Threshold network. This means access to all data encrypted using a TACo Mainnet DKG public key will be managed by a distributed set of machines, from the very first byte.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
All third-party services – digital, Web3 and beyond – impose a trust burden on the user. TACo minimizes this trust burden by disassembling and distributing sensitive cryptographic operations – key generation, access condition verification, and decryption fragment provision – across a large group of independently operated nodes. To understand TACo's trust model and read the _Mainnet_ _Trust Disclosure_, head to the [Trust Assumptions](../../app-development/threshold-access-control-tac/trust-assumptions/) section.&#x20;

To get started building on TACo Testnet, head to the [Quickstart](../../app-development/threshold-access-control-tac/quickstart-testnet.md) or [Testnet Integration ](../../app-development/threshold-access-control-tac/integration-guide/get-started-with-tac.md)page.

To understand why TACo is useful to your Web3 app, check out the simple [overview](simple-overview.md), the high-level [value propositions](value-propositions.md), or watch this [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kNXuNbWSO0).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
TACo Mainnet is scheduled for release in November 2023, as an invite-only beta. To learn more about the beta program, check out the [Mainnet Integration](../../app-development/threshold-access-control-tac/integration-guide/mainnet-beta-program.md) page.&#x20;
