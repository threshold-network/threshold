### TACo is a programmable access control plug-in that makes your Web3 app more secure, more private, and much more decentralized.&#x20;

**End-to-end encryption for everything**\
Built on the privacy-for-everyone principles of mainstream end-to-end encrypted messengers, but useful across a wider set of domains and use cases. Everything from live-streaming to connected vehicles, from secret recovery to decentralized AI compute, from journalist protection to reproductive health care.&#x20;

**Trust-minimization via threshold cryptography and a collusion-resistant node array**\
Key material management and access condition verification are operationally distributed across a diverse array of machines/servers, run by economically independent individuals and commercial entities.&#x20;

**Powerful, per-ciphertext conditionality**\
Future access to data can be made contingent on the fulfillment of predefined conditions, and those conditions attached to any granularity of data payload – a single message, an entire table, or a petabyte of video footage.&#x20;

**Flexible condition composability**\
Conditions of all types – NFT-holding, RPC, time-based, known keypairs – can be mixed-and-matched using logical operators and flexible prefix notation into virtually any desired combination. Conditions can also be flexibly surfaced at different stages of runtime.&#x20;

**Full control over access managers & network parameters**\
Developers have total and perpetual control over the cohort(s) of nodes which manage access to a given data payload, user segment or entire application. Network parameters, such as the size or composition of the cohort, can be tuned directly by the developer, or packaged into user-facing optionality to accommodate diverse risk preferences.\
_Note: parameter tuning will be available in future versions of TACo._&#x20;

**Threshold's track record for uptime, reliability and competence**\
The Threshold network's multi-app model incentivizes all TACo nodes to simultaneously provision service to tBTC, and abide by its strict availability requirements. With over [$130m](https://dune.com/threshold/tbtc) in TVL protected by Threshold nodes, TACo 'piggybacks' on tBTC's uptime, reliability, technical competence, and security track record.&#x20;

**Keypair-only decryption via** [**PRE Extension**](extensions/proxy-re-encryption-pre.md)\
If even stricter security guarantees are required, and data recipients' public keys are known in advance, developers may opt for end-user data to be re-encrypted by node operators such that they are only decryptable by pre-designated clients or public keys.\
_Note: PRE available on request._&#x20;
