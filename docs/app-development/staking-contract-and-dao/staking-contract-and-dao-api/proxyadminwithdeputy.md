# ProxyAdminWithDeputy

## ProxyAdminWithDeputy

Based on `ProxyAdmin`, an auxiliary contract in OpenZeppelin's upgradeability approach meant to act as the admin of a `TransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This variant allows an additional actor, the "deputy", to perform upgrades, which originally can only be performed by the ProxyAdmin's owner. See OpenZeppelin's documentation for `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` for more details on why a ProxyAdmin is recommended.
