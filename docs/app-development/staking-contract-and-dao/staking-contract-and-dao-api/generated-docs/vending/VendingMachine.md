# Solidity API

## VendingMachine

Contract implements a special update protocol to enable KEEP/NU
token holders to wrap their tokens and obtain T tokens according
to a fixed ratio. This will go on indefinitely and enable NU and
KEEP token holders to join T network without needing to buy or
sell any assets. Logistically, anyone holding NU or KEEP can wrap
those assets in order to upgrade to T. They can also unwrap T in
order to downgrade back to the underlying asset. There is a separate
instance of this contract deployed for KEEP holders and a separate
instance of this contract deployed for NU holders.

### WRAPPED_TOKEN_CONVERSION_PRECISION

```solidity
uint256 WRAPPED_TOKEN_CONVERSION_PRECISION
```

Number of decimal places of precision in conversion to/from
wrapped tokens (assuming typical ERC20 token with 18 decimals).
This implies that amounts of wrapped tokens below this precision
won't take part in the conversion. E.g., for a value of 3, then
for a conversion of 1.123456789 wrapped tokens, only 1.123 is
convertible (i.e., 3 decimal places), and 0.000456789 is left.

### FLOATING_POINT_DIVISOR

```solidity
uint256 FLOATING_POINT_DIVISOR
```

Divisor for precision purposes, used to represent fractions.

### wrappedToken

```solidity
contract IERC20 wrappedToken
```

The token being wrapped to T (KEEP/NU).

### tToken

```solidity
contract T tToken
```

T token contract.

### ratio

```solidity
uint256 ratio
```

The ratio with which T token is converted based on the provided
token being wrapped (KEEP/NU), expressed in 1e18 precision.

When wrapping:
x [T] = amount [KEEP/NU] * ratio / FLOATING_POINT_DIVISOR

When unwrapping:
x [KEEP/NU] = amount [T] * FLOATING_POINT_DIVISOR / ratio

### wrappedBalance

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) wrappedBalance
```

The total balance of wrapped tokens for the given holder
account. Only holders that have previously wrapped KEEP/NU to T
can unwrap, up to the amount previously wrapped.

### Wrapped

```solidity
event Wrapped(address recipient, uint256 wrappedTokenAmount, uint256 tTokenAmount)
```

### Unwrapped

```solidity
event Unwrapped(address recipient, uint256 tTokenAmount, uint256 wrappedTokenAmount)
```

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(contract IERC20 _wrappedToken, contract T _tToken, uint96 _wrappedTokenAllocation, uint96 _tTokenAllocation) public
```

Sets the reference to `wrappedToken` and `tToken`. Initializes
conversion `ratio` between wrapped token and T based on the
provided `_tTokenAllocation` and `_wrappedTokenAllocation`.

Multiplications in this contract can't overflow uint256 as we
restrict `_wrappedTokenAllocation` and `_tTokenAllocation` to
96 bits and FLOATING_POINT_DIVISOR fits in less than 60 bits.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| _wrappedToken | contract IERC20 | Address to ERC20 token that will be wrapped to T |
| _tToken | contract T | Address of T token |
| _wrappedTokenAllocation | uint96 | The total supply of the token that will be wrapped to T |
| _tTokenAllocation | uint96 | The allocation of T this instance of Vending Machine will receive |

### wrap

```solidity
function wrap(uint256 amount) external
```

Wraps up to the the given `amount` of the token (KEEP/NU) and
releases T token proportionally to the amount being wrapped with
respect to the wrap ratio. The token holder needs to have at
least the given amount of the wrapped token (KEEP/NU) approved
to transfer to the Vending Machine before calling this function.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| amount | uint256 | The amount of KEEP/NU to be wrapped |

### receiveApproval

```solidity
function receiveApproval(address from, uint256 amount, address token, bytes) external
```

Wraps up to the given amount of the token (KEEP/NU) and releases
T token proportionally to the amount being wrapped with respect
to the wrap ratio. This is a shortcut to `wrap` function that
avoids a separate approval transaction. Only KEEP/NU token
is allowed as a caller, so please call this function via
token's `approveAndCall`.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| from | address | Caller's address, must be the same as `wrappedToken` field |
| amount | uint256 | The amount of KEEP/NU to be wrapped |
| token | address | Token's address, must be the same as `wrappedToken` field |
|  | bytes |  |

### unwrap

```solidity
function unwrap(uint256 amount) external
```

Unwraps up to the given `amount` of T back to the legacy token
(KEEP/NU) according to the wrap ratio. It can only be called by
a token holder who previously wrapped their tokens in this
vending machine contract. The token holder can't unwrap more
tokens than they originally wrapped. The token holder needs to
have at least the given amount of T tokens approved to transfer
to the Vending Machine before calling this function.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| amount | uint256 | The amount of T to unwrap back to the collateral (KEEP/NU) |

### conversionToT

```solidity
function conversionToT(uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256 tAmount, uint256 wrappedRemainder)
```

Returns the T token amount that's obtained from `amount` wrapped
tokens (KEEP/NU), and the remainder that can't be upgraded.

### conversionFromT

```solidity
function conversionFromT(uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256 wrappedAmount, uint256 tRemainder)
```

The amount of wrapped tokens (KEEP/NU) that's obtained from
`amount` T tokens, and the remainder that can't be downgraded.

### _wrap

```solidity
function _wrap(address tokenHolder, uint256 wrappedTokenAmount) internal
```

### _unwrap

```solidity
function _unwrap(address tokenHolder, uint256 tTokenAmount) internal
```
