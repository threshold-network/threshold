# Solidity API

## TokenStaking

TokenStaking is the main staking contract of the Threshold Network.
Apart from the basic usage of enabling T stakes, it also acts as a
sort of "meta-staking" contract, accepting existing legacy NU/KEEP
stakes. Additionally, it serves as application manager for the apps
that run on the Threshold Network. Note that legacy NU/KEEP staking
contracts see TokenStaking as an application (e.g., slashing is
requested by TokenStaking and performed by the legacy contracts).

TokenStaking is upgradeable, using OpenZeppelin's Upgradeability
framework. As such, it is required to satisfy OZ's guidelines, like
restrictions on constructors, immutable variables, base contracts and
libraries. See https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable

```

### stake

```solidity
function stake(address stakingProvider, address payable beneficiary, address authorizer, uint96 amount) external
```

Creates a delegation with `msg.sender` owner with the given
staking provider, beneficiary, and authorizer. Transfers the
given amount of T to the staking contract.

The owner of the delegation needs to have the amount approved to
transfer to the staking contract.

### stakeKeep

```solidity
function stakeKeep(address stakingProvider) external
```

Copies delegation from the legacy KEEP staking contract to T
staking contract. No tokens are transferred. Caches the active
stake amount from KEEP staking contract. Can be called by
anyone.

The staking provider in T staking contract is the legacy KEEP
staking contract operator.

### stakeNu

```solidity
function stakeNu(address stakingProvider, address payable beneficiary, address authorizer) external

staking contract, additionally appointing beneficiary and

contract. Can be called only by the original delegation owner.

### setMinimumStakeAmount

```solidity
function setMinimumStakeAmount(uint96 amount) external

contract and individual applications are allowed to require
higher minimum stakes if necessary.

Staking providers are not required to maintain a minimum T stake
all the time. 24 hours after the delegation, T stake can be reduced
below the minimum stake. The minimum stake in the staking contract
is just to protect against griefing stake operation. Please note
that each application may have its own minimum authorization though
and the authorization can not be higher than the stake.

for each authorized application. See `IApplication`.

### approveAuthorizationDecrease

the liquid T stake amount. Can be called only by the owner or
the staking provider. Can only be called when 24h passed since
the stake has been delegated.

### unstakeKeep

```solidity
function unstakeKeep(address stakingProvider) external
```

Sets the legacy KEEP staking contract active stake amount cached
in T staking contract to 0. Reverts if the amount of liquid T

network and earning rewards based on the liquid T staked. Can be
called only by the delegation owner or the staking provider.
Can only be called when 24h passed since the stake has been
delegated.

Reverts if there is at least one authorization higher than the
sum of remaining legacy NU stake and liquid T stake for that
staking provider or if the untaked amount is higher than the
cached legacy stake amount. If succeeded, the legacy NU stake
can be partially or fully undelegated on the legacy staking
contract. This function allows to unstake from NU staking
contract and still being able to operate in T network and
earning rewards based on the liquid T staked. Can be called only
by the delegation owner or the staking provider. Can only be
called when 24h passed since the stake has been delegated.

has been delegated.

### getMinStaked

```solidity
function getMinStaked(address stakingProvider, enum IStaking.StakeType stakeTypes) public view returns (uint96)
```

Returns minimum possible stake for T, KEEP or NU in T denomination

For example, suppose the given staking provider has 10 T, 20 T worth
of KEEP, and 30 T worth of NU all staked, and the maximum
application authorization is 40 T, then `getMinStaked` for
that staking provider returns:
* 0 T if KEEP stake type specified i.e.
min = 40 T max - (10 T + 30 T worth of NU) = 0 T
* 10 T if NU stake type specified i.e.
min = 40 T max - (10 T + 20 T worth of KEEP) = 10 T
* 0 T if T stake type specified i.e.
min = 40 T max - (20 T worth of KEEP + 30 T worth of NU) < 0 T
In other words, the minimum stake amount for the specified
stake type is the minimum amount of stake of the given type
