# T

## T

Threshold Network T token

By default, token balance does not account for voting power. This makes transfers cheaper. The downside is that it requires users to delegate to themselves to activate checkpoints and have their voting power tracked.

### DELEGATION\_TYPEHASH

```solidity
bytes32 DELEGATION_TYPEHASH
```

The EIP-712 typehash for the delegation struct used by `delegateBySig`.

### constructor

```solidity
constructor() public
```

### delegateBySig

```solidity
function delegateBySig(address signatory, address delegatee, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external
```

Delegates votes from signatory to `delegatee`

#### Parameters

| Name      | Type    | Description                               |

| signatory | address |                                           |
| delegatee | address | The address to delegate votes to          |
| deadline  | uint256 | The time at which to expire the signature |
| v         | uint8   | The recovery byte of the signature        |
| r         | bytes32 | Half of the ECDSA signature pair          |
| s         | bytes32 | Half of the ECDSA signature pair          |

### delegate

```solidity
function delegate(address delegatee) public virtual
```

Delegate votes from `msg.sender` to `delegatee`.

#### Parameters

| Name      | Type    | Description                      |
| --------- | ------- | -------------------------------- |
| delegatee | address | The address to delegate votes to |

### beforeTokenTransfer

```solidity
function beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal
```

Hook that is called before any transfer of tokens. This includes minting and burning.

Calling conditions:

* when `from` and `to` are both non-zero, `amount` of `from`'s tokens will be to transferred to `to`.
* when `from` is zero, `amount` tokens will be minted for `to`.
* when `to` is zero, `amount` of `from`'s tokens will be burned.
* `from` and `to` are never both zero.

### delegate

```solidity
function delegate(address delegator, address delegatee) internal virtual
```

Change delegation for `delegator` to `delegatee`.
