# Ask Your Provider

This page is a reference for users, app developers, and other partners/participants in the Web3 ecosystem. Before integrating an infrastructure layer, staking on a protocol, moving assets across a bridge, or even just using any Web3 application – we recommend seeking answers to the following questions. Given that **Web3's core value proposition is reducing imposed trust via decentralization,** the current 'state of trust' should be accessible and easy to understand. Not every imperfection can can be ironed out prior to launch, but if some component of a Web3 product isn't practically and meaningfully decentralized, there should be a reasonable explanation, and a clear path towards addressing the limitation.

For a proactive disclosure of the **TACo** application from a trust, risk and security perspective, see the TACo [Provider Answers](threshold-access-control-tac/trust-assumptions/provider-answers-disclosure.md) page.

Ask your provider:&#x20;

_-> About the network-level distribution of trust_

* How many node operators (stakers) serve the network?
* How are node operators (stakers) incentivized to follow the protocol? How are they recruited, mobilized and coordinated?
* How is the independence between node operators discerned?
* How is control of the token supply distributed? How are centralizing forces mitigated? &#x20;
* How are nodes sampled and selected in order to populate active service groups or cohorts?&#x20;

_-> About entities with disproportionate power_

* What damage can the DAO theoretically inflict on the network or its users?&#x20;
* What can commercial entities associated with the network do behind closed doors? What can they only do publicly and/or with a guaranteed delay? What are the internal governance procedures at the associated commercial entities? Are reputation preservation and/or legal repercussions the primary disincentives for malicious or negligent behavior?&#x20;
* What other entities have disproportionate power? What control is ceded by delegators to professional stakers and/or Staking-as-a-Service providers, and how does this affect the trust assumptions?&#x20;

_-> About infrastructural and software-related centralization_

* How does the user-facing client connect to the provider’s network? How does it connect to other layers?
* How does the provider connect to the Ethereum network (or alternative base layer)?&#x20;
* How and from where is the client downloaded/installed? How open source is the project – both the user-facing client, and the node operator-facing client? How transparent is ongoing research, design & implementation? How clear-cut and coherent is the advertised path towards decentralization? &#x20;
