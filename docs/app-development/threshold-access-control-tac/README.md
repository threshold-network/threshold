# Threshold Access Control

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Update (02.28.23)** \
The [Proof-of-Concept version](get-started-with-tac.md) is now configured for compatibility with Polygon Mainnet, which means discontinuing the service on Mumbai (Polygon Testnet). Conditions will only be evaluated if they are specified on **Polygon Mainnet**, and will not be evaluated if they pertain to some state on Mumbai (e.g. grant access if a wallet holds a certain number of testnet MATIC).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Use Threshold Access Control for end-to-end encrypted, end-to-end decentralized data sharing and communication.&#x20;
