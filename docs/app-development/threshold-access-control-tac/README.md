# TACo Access Control

TACo is used for end-to-end encrypted, end-to-end decentralized data sharing and communication. See [threshold-access-control](../../applications/threshold-access-control/ "mention") in the Applications section for the key concepts and value propositions.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
All third-party services – digital, Web3 or otherwise – impose a trust burden on the user. TACo minimizes the trust imposition by disassembling and distributing sensitive cryptographic operations across a cohort of **independently operated** nodes. To understand TACo's trust model better, and the trust levers available to the adopting developer, head to the [Trust Assumptions](trust-assumptions/) section.&#x20;
