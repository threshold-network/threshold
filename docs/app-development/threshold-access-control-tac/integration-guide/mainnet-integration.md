# Mainnet Integration

{% hint style="warning" %}
TACo is not yet available on Mainnet. Until then, we advise getting familiar with the [Testnet](get-started-with-tac.md) version (Tapir). The instructions on this page serve as a preview of the steps required to join the invite-only beta program, which will commence shortly after Mainnet deployment.
{% endhint %}

To initiate a TACO Mainnet DKG ritual and generate a cohort of Threshold nodes (stakers who have authorized their T collateral to serve the TACo application), adopting developers must do the following:&#x20;

(1) Ask to join the beta program. You may make this request in the Threshold Discord [#taco](https://discord.com/channels/866378471868727316/870383642751430666) channel. Note that we cannot accommodate all requests, due to team bandwidth and the current gas constraints of cohort member replacement. These restrictions will loosen over time.&#x20;

(2) Provide the Polygon wallet address they wish to designate as Cohort Authority for a unique DKG ritual and cohort of nodes.\
\
(3) Complete the payment into the [Threshold Integrations Guild multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=safe%3Dmatic:0x5bD70E385414C8dCC25305AeB7E542d8FC70e667), which will act as the Sponsor (only for the beta program). Your designated Polygon address will be the Cohort Authority, and you will be able to control the Sponsor role going forward. See the [Fee Model](../fee-model.md) page for the price points and top-up requirements.&#x20;

(4) Follow the set-up instructions detailed in the [Integration Guide](./).&#x20;
