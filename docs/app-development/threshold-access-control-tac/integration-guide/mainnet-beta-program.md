# Mainnet TACO: Beta Program

{% hint style="info" %}
Mainnet TACo launched in January 2024. The information below is for those seeking access to the invite-only **beta program**. We advise getting familiar with the [Testnet](../integration-guides/get-started-with-tac.md) version (Tapir) before requesting access to the beta program and Mainnet TACo.
{% endhint %}

In order to use TACo in production – i.e. the fully decentralized, mainnet version of TACo – adopting developers must be furnished with their own DKG public key. This key is used to encrypt their application's users' data. It is generated by a unique cohort of Threshold nodes via a DKG Initialization Ritual, and those same set of nodes collectively manage access to the users' data. The public key – along with authority over the cohort – will be controlled by the adopting developer until they decide to devolve power to a DAO, multisig or any kind of contract. \
\
In TACo's genesis era, initiating a DKG ritual requires some manual steps:&#x20;

(1) Ask to join the **beta program**. You may make this request in the Threshold Discord [#taco](https://discord.com/channels/866378471868727316/870383642751430666) channel.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
The NuCypher team – core contributors to the Threshold Network and developers of TACo – currently gate-keeps access to the TACO beta program. This is due to constraints on the team's bandwidth, and also complex long-term gas costs of replacing cohort members. This means that not all requests to join the beta program will be granted immediately, but the number of developers provisioned with a DKG public key (and cohort) will increase steadily over time.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

(2) Provide the Polygon wallet address they wish to designate as 'Cohort Admin'. This address will exclusively control a unique `ritualID`, DKG public key, and associated cohort of TACo nodes.\
\
(3) Complete the payment into a proxy contract, which will escrow the funds until the DKG Initialization Ritual is complete, at which point the payment will be transferred to the Threshold Treasury Guild. During the beta program, this proxy contract will act as an intermediary 'Sponsor' of the Cohort. However, as the Cohort Authority, the designated Polygon address will have complete control over the DKG public key, the cohort parameters, and power over the Sponsor role going forward. See the [Fee Model](../fee-model.md) page for more on the fee structure, the price points, and the top-up requirements.&#x20;

(4) Follow the set-up instructions detailed in the [Mainnet integration guide](../integration-guides/mainnet-taco-integration.md).
