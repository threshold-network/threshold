# Testnet TACo Program

## Testnet domains

To run TACo on testnet, it needs to be configured to use one of the two available domains:

```typescript
import { domains } from '@nucypher/taco';

domains.DEVNET  // "lynx" network
domains.TESTNET // "tapir" network
```

* `DEVNET` domain, or `lynx`, is a bleeding-edge developer network that supports upcoming `taco` release.
* `TESTNET` domain, or `tapir`, is a stable testnet environment that supports the current `taco` release.

We encourage you to use the `TESTNET` domain for developing `taco` based apps, and to use `DEVNET` to test compatibility with the upcoming `taco` release and new, experimental features.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Both `DEVNET` and `TESTNET` domains are unsuitable for use in a production setting. Testnet domains have no trust minimization or stability guarantees, which makes them unfit for production or real-world data payloads. Learn more about this in the [trust assumptions](../trust-assumptions/testnet-trust-assumptions/) section.

{% hint style="info" %}
Open `ritualID` refers to a DKG cohort & public key with no restrictions on encryptors â€“ i.e. any device or address can use the public key to encrypt data. See the [encryptor allowlist](../user-authentication/encryptor-allowlist.md) section to learn more.

## Contracts

The source code for contracts used on testnet can be found in [`nucypher/nucypher-contracts`](https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher-contracts) repository.&#x20;

Contract addresses for testnets can be found in their respective contract registries:

* [`lynx.json`](https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher-contracts/blob/main/deployment/artifacts/lynx.json)
* [`tapir.json`](https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher-contracts/blob/main/deployment/artifacts/tapir.json)
