# Testnet Trust Model

The Testnet (Tapir) version exists to help developers familiarize themselves with the SDK, API and other architectural/design choices. **It is not intended to be utilized as a trust-minimized service**. Hence, the trust assumptions are strictly worse than the Mainnet version, particularly with respect to the node array managing decryption fragments and validating condition (non/)fulfillment. Nodes are running on a staker-facing Testnet, are operated primarily by members of the NuCypher commercial entity, and are not subject to a cryptoeconomic protocol or required to deposit collateral.
