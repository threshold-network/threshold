# Testnet Trust Assumptions

The Tapir testnet exists to help developers familiarize themselves with the TACo API and related architecture. **It is not intended to be utilized as a trust-minimized or decentralized service**.&#x20;

Hence, the trust assumptions are strictly worse than the Mainnet version, particularly with respect to the node array managing decryption fragments and validating condition (non/)fulfillment. Tapir nodes are running on a staker-facing Testnet, are operated primarily by members of the NuCypher commercial entity, and are not subject to a cryptoeconomic protocol or required to lock any collateral.
