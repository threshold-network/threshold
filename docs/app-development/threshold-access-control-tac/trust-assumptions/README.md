# Trust Assumptions

As the only decentralized end-to-end encryption service on the market, TACo is also arguably the most 'trustless' access control layer available to Web3 app buidlers – or indeed, available to any developer seeking a departure from the exploitative Web 2.0 trust paradigm.&#x20;

Nevertheless, there is no such thing as a third-party integration (or service in general) that imposes _zero_ additional trust burden onto the application's end-users. Rather, when choosing infrastructural technology, it is the nature and texture of the trust burden(s) – or the 'trust assumptions' – that truly matter.&#x20;

**Note that many projects in the Web3 infrastructure space seek to obscure this reality by loosely labelling their solution as 'decentralized', but fail to explain precisely what the trust implications are in practice. Beware of ambiguity!**
{% endhint %}

In TACo's case, the trust assumptions are: \
\
_non-binary –_ not reducible to 'trustless' or 'trustful'.

_non-static –_ they evolve over time based on in-protocol features and exogeneous phenomena. \
\
_tunable –_ adopting developers will eventually select from a range of explicit trust assumptions on behalf of their user base, and/or surface that optionality for end-users to choose themselves.&#x20;

This section serves to explain the implicit and explicit trust assumptions baked into TACo, for both the [Mainnet](../../ask-your-provider.md) and [Testnet](../integration-guide/get-started-with-tac.md)[ ](cbd-proof-of-concept-version.md)versions. In later versions, these assumptions will be synthesized and exposed to the vast majority of adopting developers in the form of pre-configured network parameter packages.&#x20;
