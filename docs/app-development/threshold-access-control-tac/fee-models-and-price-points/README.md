# Fee Models & Price Points

TACo will eventually have two fee models working in tandem:&#x20;

(1) [Duration-based API-fee](duration-based-fees.md)

(2) [Action-based, contract-enforced fee ](action-based-fees.md)

The genesis version (v7.0.0) will only require payment of the duration-based fee. The action-based fee will vary depending on the use case or domain. \
