# Solidity API

## Heartbeat

The library establishes expected format for heartbeat messages
signed by wallet ECDSA signing group. Heartbeat messages are
constructed in such a way that they can not be used as a Bitcoin
transaction preimages.

The smallest Bitcoin non-coinbase transaction is a one spending an
OP_TRUE anyonecanspend output and creating 1 OP_TRUE anyonecanspend
output. Such a transaction has 61 bytes (see `BitcoinTx` documentation):
4  bytes  for version
1  byte   for tx_in_count
36 bytes  for tx_in.previous_output
1  byte   for tx_in.script_bytes (value: 0)
0  bytes  for tx_in.signature_script
4  bytes  for tx_in.sequence
1  byte   for tx_out_count
8  bytes  for tx_out.value
1  byte   for tx_out.pk_script_bytes
1  byte   for tx_out.pk_script
4  bytes  for lock_time

The smallest Bitcoin coinbase transaction is a one creating
1 OP_TRUE anyonecanspend output and having an empty coinbase script.
Such a transaction has 65 bytes:
4  bytes  for version
1  byte   for tx_in_count
32 bytes  for tx_in.hash  (all 0x00)
4  bytes  for tx_in.index (all 0xff)
1  byte   for tx_in.script_bytes (value: 0)
4  bytes  for tx_in.height
0  byte   for tx_in.coinbase_script
4  bytes  for tx_in.sequence
1  byte   for tx_out_count
8  bytes  for tx_out.value
1  byte   for tx_out.pk_script_bytes
1  byte   for tx_out.pk_script
4  bytes  for lock_time

A SIGHASH flag is used to indicate which part of the transaction is
signed by the ECDSA signature. There are currently 3 flags:
SIGHASH_ALL, SIGHASH_NONE, SIGHASH_SINGLE, and different combinations
of these flags.

No matter the SIGHASH flag and no matter the combination, the following
fields from the transaction are always included in the constructed
preimage:
4  bytes  for version
36 bytes  for tx_in.previous_output (or tx_in.hash + tx_in.index for coinbase)
4  bytes  for lock_time

Additionally, the last 4 bytes of the preimage determines the SIGHASH
flag.

This is enough to say there is no way the preimage could be shorter
than 4 + 36 + 4 + 4 = 48 bytes.

For this reason, we construct the heartbeat message, as a 16-byte
message. The first 8 bytes are 0xffffffffffffffff. The last 8 bytes
are for an arbitrary uint64, being a signed heartbeat nonce (for
example, the last Ethereum block hash).

The message being signed by the wallet when executing the heartbeat
protocol should be Bitcoin's hash256 (double SHA-256) of the heartbeat
message:
heartbeat_sighash = hash256(heartbeat_message)

### isValidHeartbeatMessage

```solidity
function isValidHeartbeatMessage(bytes message) internal pure returns (bool)
```

Determines if the signed byte array is a valid, non-fraudulent
heartbeat message.

Wallet heartbeat message must be exactly 16 bytes long with the first
8 bytes set to 0xffffffffffffffff.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| message | bytes | Message signed by the wallet. It is a potential heartbeat message, Bitcoin transaction preimage, or an arbitrary signed bytes. |

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| [0] | bool | True if valid heartbeat message, false otherwise. |
