# Solidity API

## Bridge

Bridge manages BTC deposit and redemption flow and is increasing and
decreasing balances in the Bank as a result of BTC deposit and
redemption operations performed by depositors and redeemers.

Depositors send BTC funds to the most recently created off-chain
ECDSA wallet of the bridge using pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) or
pay-to-witness-script-hash (P2WSH) containing hashed information
about the depositorâ€™s Ethereum address. Then, the depositor reveals
their Ethereum address along with their deposit blinding factor,
refund public key hash and refund locktime to the Bridge on Ethereum
chain. The off-chain ECDSA wallet listens for these sorts of
messages and when it gets one, it checks the Bitcoin network to make
sure the deposit lines up. If it does, the off-chain ECDSA wallet
may decide to pick the deposit transaction for sweeping, and when
the sweep operation is confirmed on the Bitcoin network, the ECDSA
wallet informs the Bridge about the sweep increasing appropriate
balances in the Bank.

Bridge is an upgradeable component of the Bank. The order of
functionalities in this contract is: deposit, sweep, redemption,
moving funds, wallet lifecycle, frauds, parameters.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| _bank | address | Address of the Bank the Bridge belongs to. |
| _relay | address | Address of the Bitcoin relay providing the current Bitcoin network difficulty. |
| _treasury | address | Address where the deposit and redemption treasury fees will be sent to. |
| _ecdsaWalletRegistry | address | Address of the ECDSA Wallet Registry contract. |
| _reimbursementPool | address payable | Address of the Reimbursement Pool contract. |

### revealDeposit

```solidity
function revealDeposit(struct BitcoinTx.Info fundingTx, struct Deposit.DepositRevealInfo reveal) external
```

Used by the depositor to reveal information about their P2(W)SH
Bitcoin deposit to the Bridge on Ethereum chain. The off-chain
wallet listens for revealed deposit events and may decide to
include the revealed deposit in the next executed sweep.
Information about the Bitcoin deposit can be revealed before or
after the Bitcoin transaction with P2(W)SH deposit is mined on
the Bitcoin chain. Worth noting, the gas cost of this function
scales with the number of P2(W)SH transaction inputs and
outputs. The deposit may be routed to one of the trusted vaults.
When a deposit is routed to a vault, vault gets notified when
the deposit gets swept and it may execute the appropriate action.

Requirements:
- This function must be called by the same Ethereum address as the
one used in the P2(W)SH BTC deposit transaction as a depositor,
- `reveal.walletPubKeyHash` must identify a `Live` wallet,
- `reveal.vault` must be 0x0 or point to a trusted vault,
- `reveal.fundingOutputIndex` must point to the actual P2(W)SH
output of the BTC deposit transaction,
- `reveal.blindingFactor` must be the blinding factor used in the
P2(W)SH BTC deposit transaction,
- `reveal.walletPubKeyHash` must be the wallet pub key hash used in
the P2(W)SH BTC deposit transaction,
- `reveal.refundPubKeyHash` must be the refund pub key hash used in
the P2(W)SH BTC deposit transaction,
- `reveal.refundLocktime` must be the refund locktime used in the
P2(W)SH BTC deposit transaction,
- BTC deposit for the given `fundingTxHash`, `fundingOutputIndex`
can be revealed only one time.

If any of these requirements is not met, the wallet _must_ refuse
to sweep the deposit and the depositor has to wait until the
deposit script unlocks to receive their BTC back.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| fundingTx | struct BitcoinTx.Info | Bitcoin funding transaction data, see `BitcoinTx.Info`. |
| reveal | struct Deposit.DepositRevealInfo | Deposit reveal data, see `RevealInfo struct. |

### submitDepositSweepProof

```solidity
function submitDepositSweepProof(struct BitcoinTx.Info sweepTx, struct BitcoinTx.Proof sweepProof, struct BitcoinTx.UTXO mainUtxo, address vault) external
```

Used by the wallet to prove the BTC deposit sweep transaction
and to update Bank balances accordingly. Sweep is only accepted
if it satisfies SPV proof.

The function is performing Bank balance updates by first
computing the Bitcoin fee for the sweep transaction. The fee is
divided evenly between all swept deposits. Each depositor
receives a balance in the bank equal to the amount inferred
during the reveal transaction, minus their fee share.

It is possible to prove the given sweep only one time.

Requirements:
- `sweepTx` components must match the expected structure. See
`BitcoinTx.Info` docs for reference. Their values must exactly
correspond to appropriate Bitcoin transaction fields to produce
a provable transaction hash,
- The `sweepTx` should represent a Bitcoin transaction with 1..n
inputs. If the wallet has no main UTXO, all n inputs should
correspond to P2(W)SH revealed deposits UTXOs. If the wallet has
an existing main UTXO, one of the n inputs must point to that
main UTXO and remaining n-1 inputs should correspond to P2(W)SH
revealed deposits UTXOs. That transaction must have only
one P2(W)PKH output locking funds on the 20-byte wallet public
key hash,
- All revealed deposits that are swept by `sweepTx` must have
their `vault` parameters set to the same address as the address
passed in the `vault` function parameter,
- `sweepProof` components must match the expected structure. See
`BitcoinTx.Proof` docs for reference. The `bitcoinHeaders`
field must contain a valid number of block headers, not less
than the `txProofDifficultyFactor` contract constant,
- `mainUtxo` components must point to the recent main UTXO
of the given wallet, as currently known on the Ethereum chain.
If there is no main UTXO, this parameter is ignored.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| sweepTx | struct BitcoinTx.Info | Bitcoin sweep transaction data. |
| sweepProof | struct BitcoinTx.Proof | Bitcoin sweep proof data. |
| mainUtxo | struct BitcoinTx.UTXO | Data of the wallet's main UTXO, as currently known on the Ethereum chain. If no main UTXO exists for the given wallet, this parameter is ignored. |
| vault | address | Optional address of the vault where all swept deposits should be routed to. All deposits swept as part of the transaction must have their `vault` parameters set to the same address. If this parameter is set to an address of a trusted vault, swept deposits are routed to that vault. If this parameter is set to the zero address or to an address of a non-trusted vault, swept deposits are not routed to a vault but depositors' balances are increased in the Bank individually. |

### requestRedemption

```solidity
function requestRedemption(bytes20 walletPubKeyHash, struct BitcoinTx.UTXO mainUtxo, bytes redeemerOutputScript, uint64 amount) external
```

Requests redemption of the given amount from the specified
wallet to the redeemer Bitcoin output script. Handles the
simplest case in which the redeemer's balance is decreased in
the Bank.

Requirements:
- Wallet behind `walletPubKeyHash` must be live,
- `mainUtxo` components must point to the recent main UTXO
of the given wallet, as currently known on the Ethereum chain,
- `redeemerOutputScript` must be a proper Bitcoin script,
- `redeemerOutputScript` cannot have wallet PKH as payload,
- `amount` must be above or equal the `redemptionDustThreshold`,
- Given `walletPubKeyHash` and `redeemerOutputScript` pair can be
used for only one pending request at the same time,
- Wallet must have enough Bitcoin balance to process the request,
- Redeemer must make an allowance in the Bank that the Bridge
contract can spend the given `amount`.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| walletPubKeyHash | bytes20 | The 20-byte wallet public key hash (computed using Bitcoin HASH160 over the compressed ECDSA public key). |
| mainUtxo | struct BitcoinTx.UTXO | Data of the wallet's main UTXO, as currently known on the Ethereum chain. |
| redeemerOutputScript | bytes | The redeemer's length-prefixed output script (P2PKH, P2WPKH, P2SH or P2WSH) that will be used to lock redeemed BTC. |
| amount | uint64 | Requested amount in satoshi. This is also the Bank balance that is taken from the `balanceOwner` upon request. Once the request is handled, the actual amount of BTC locked on the redeemer output script will be always lower than this value since the treasury and Bitcoin transaction fees must be incurred. The minimal amount satisfying the request can be computed as: `amount - (amount / redemptionTreasuryFeeDivisor) - redemptionTxMaxFee`. Fees values are taken at the moment of request creation. |

### receiveBalanceApproval

```solidity
function receiveBalanceApproval(address balanceOwner, uint256 amount, bytes redemptionData) external
```

Requests redemption of the given amount from the specified
wallet to the redeemer Bitcoin output script. Used by
`Bank.approveBalanceAndCall`. Can handle more complex cases
where balance owner may be someone else than the redeemer.
For example, vault redeeming its balance for some depositor.

Requirements:
- The caller must be the Bank,
- Wallet behind `walletPubKeyHash` must be live,
- `mainUtxo` components must point to the recent main UTXO
of the given wallet, as currently known on the Ethereum chain,
- `redeemerOutputScript` must be a proper Bitcoin script,
- `redeemerOutputScript` cannot have wallet PKH as payload,
- `amount` must be above or equal the `redemptionDustThreshold`,
- Given `walletPubKeyHash` and `redeemerOutputScript` pair can be
used for only one pending request at the same time,
- Wallet must have enough Bitcoin balance to process the request.

Note on upgradeability:
Bridge is an upgradeable contract deployed behind
a TransparentUpgradeableProxy. Accepting redemption data as bytes
provides great flexibility. The Bridge is just like any other
contract with a balance approved in the Bank and can be upgraded
to another version without being bound to a particular interface
forever. This flexibility comes with the cost - developers
integrating their vaults and dApps with `Bridge` using
`approveBalanceAndCall` need to pay extra attention to
`redemptionData` and adjust the code in case the expected structure
of `redemptionData`  changes.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| balanceOwner | address | The address of the Bank balance owner whose balance is getting redeemed. |
| amount | uint256 | Requested amount in satoshi. This is also the Bank balance that is taken from the `balanceOwner` upon request. Once the request is handled, the actual amount of BTC locked on the redeemer output script will be always lower than this value since the treasury and Bitcoin transaction fees must be incurred. The minimal amount satisfying the request can be computed as: `amount - (amount / redemptionTreasuryFeeDivisor) - redemptionTxMaxFee`. Fees values are taken at the moment of request creation. |
| redemptionData | bytes | ABI-encoded redemption data: [ address redeemer, bytes20 walletPubKeyHash, bytes32 mainUtxoTxHash, uint32 mainUtxoTxOutputIndex, uint64 mainUtxoTxOutputValue, bytes redeemerOutputScript ] - redeemer: The Ethereum address of the redeemer who will be able to claim Bank balance if anything goes wrong during the redemption. In the most basic case, when someone redeems their balance from the Bank, `balanceOwner` is the same as `redeemer`. However, when a Vault is redeeming part of its balance for some redeemer address (for example, someone who has earlier deposited into that Vault), `balanceOwner` is the Vault, and `redeemer` is the address for which the vault is redeeming its balance to, - walletPubKeyHash: The 20-byte wallet public key hash (computed using Bitcoin HASH160 over the compressed ECDSA public key), - mainUtxoTxHash: Data of the wallet's main UTXO TX hash, as currently known on the Ethereum chain, - mainUtxoTxOutputIndex: Data of the wallet's main UTXO output index, as currently known on Ethereum chain, - mainUtxoTxOutputValue: Data of the wallet's main UTXO output value, as currently known on Ethereum chain, - redeemerOutputScript The redeemer's length-prefixed output script (P2PKH, P2WPKH, P2SH or P2WSH) that will be used to lock redeemed BTC. |

### submitRedemptionProof

```solidity
function submitRedemptionProof(struct BitcoinTx.Info redemptionTx, struct BitcoinTx.Proof redemptionProof, struct BitcoinTx.UTXO mainUtxo, bytes20 walletPubKeyHash) external
```

Used by the wallet to prove the BTC redemption transaction
and to make the necessary bookkeeping. Redemption is only
accepted if it satisfies SPV proof.

The function is performing Bank balance updates by burning
the total redeemed Bitcoin amount from Bridge balance and
transferring the treasury fee sum to the treasury address.

It is possible to prove the given redemption only one time.

Requirements:
- `redemptionTx` components must match the expected structure. See
`BitcoinTx.Info` docs for reference. Their values must exactly
correspond to appropriate Bitcoin transaction fields to produce
a provable transaction hash,
- The `redemptionTx` should represent a Bitcoin transaction with
exactly 1 input that refers to the wallet's main UTXO. That
transaction should have 1..n outputs handling existing pending
redemption requests or pointing to reported timed out requests.
There can be also 1 optional output representing the
change and pointing back to the 20-byte wallet public key hash.
The change should be always present if the redeemed value sum
is lower than the total wallet's BTC balance,
- `redemptionProof` components must match the expected structure.
See `BitcoinTx.Proof` docs for reference. The `bitcoinHeaders`
field must contain a valid number of block headers, not less
than the `txProofDifficultyFactor` contract constant,
- `mainUtxo` components must point to the recent main UTXO
of the given wallet, as currently known on the Ethereum chain.
Additionally, the recent main UTXO on Ethereum must be set,
- `walletPubKeyHash` must be connected with the main UTXO used
as transaction single input.
Other remarks:
- Putting the change output as the first transaction output can
save some gas because the output processing loop begins each
iteration by checking whether the given output is the change
thus uses some gas for making the comparison. Once the change
is identified, that check is omitted in further iterations.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| redemptionTx | struct BitcoinTx.Info | Bitcoin redemption transaction data. |
| redemptionProof | struct BitcoinTx.Proof | Bitcoin redemption proof data. |
| mainUtxo | struct BitcoinTx.UTXO | Data of the wallet's main UTXO, as currently known on the Ethereum chain. |
| walletPubKeyHash | bytes20 | 20-byte public key hash (computed using Bitcoin HASH160 over the compressed ECDSA public key) of the wallet which performed the redemption transaction. |

### notifyRedemptionTimeout

```solidity
function notifyRedemptionTimeout(bytes20 walletPubKeyHash, uint32[] walletMembersIDs, bytes redeemerOutputScript) external
```

Notifies that there is a pending redemption request associated
with the given wallet, that has timed out. The redemption
request is identified by the key built as
`keccak256(keccak256(redeemerOutputScript) | walletPubKeyHash)`.
The results of calling this function:
- The pending redemptions value for the wallet will be decreased
by the requested amount (minus treasury fee),
- The tokens taken from the redeemer on redemption request will
be returned to the redeemer,
- The request will be moved from pending redemptions to
timed-out redemptions,
- If the state of the wallet is `Live` or `MovingFunds`, the
wallet operators will be slashed and the notifier will be
rewarded,
- If the state of wallet is `Live`, the wallet will be closed or
marked as `MovingFunds` (depending on the presence or absence
of the wallet's main UTXO) and the wallet will no longer be
marked as the active wallet (if it was marked as such).

Requirements:
- The wallet must be in the Live or MovingFunds or Terminated state,
- The redemption request identified by `walletPubKeyHash` and
`redeemerOutputScript` must exist,
- The expression `keccak256(abi.encode(walletMembersIDs))` must
be exactly the same as the hash stored under `membersIdsHash`
for the given `walletID`. Those IDs are not directly stored
in the contract for gas efficiency purposes but they can be
read from appropriate `DkgResultSubmitted` and `DkgResultApproved`
events of the `WalletRegistry` contract,
- The amount of time defined by `redemptionTimeout` must have
passed since the redemption was requested (the request must be
timed-out).

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| walletPubKeyHash | bytes20 | 20-byte public key hash of the wallet. |
| walletMembersIDs | uint32[] | Identifiers of the wallet signing group members. |

### submitMovedFundsSweepProof

```solidity
function submitMovedFundsSweepProof(struct BitcoinTx.Info sweepTx, struct BitcoinTx.Proof sweepProof, struct BitcoinTx.UTXO mainUtxo) external
```

Used by the wallet to prove the BTC moved funds sweep
transaction and to make the necessary state changes. Moved
funds sweep is only accepted if it satisfies SPV proof.

The function validates the sweep transaction structure by
checking if it actually spends the moved funds UTXO and the
sweeping wallet's main UTXO (optionally), and if it locks the
value on the sweeping wallet's 20-byte public key hash using a
reasonable transaction fee. If all preconditions are
met, this function updates the sweeping wallet main UTXO, thus
their BTC balance.

It is possible to prove the given sweep transaction only
one time.

Requirements:
- `sweepTx` components must match the expected structure. See
`BitcoinTx.Info` docs for reference. Their values must exactly
correspond to appropriate Bitcoin transaction fields to produce
a provable transaction hash,
- The `sweepTx` should represent a Bitcoin transaction with

Terminated state,
- The expression `keccak256(abi.encode(walletMembersIDs))` must
be exactly the same as the hash stored under `membersIdsHash`
for the given `walletID`. Those IDs are not directly stored
in the contract for gas efficiency purposes but they can be
read from appropriate `DkgResultSubmitted` and `DkgResultApproved`
events of the `WalletRegistry` contract.

#### Parameters

Registry will notify this contract by calling the
`__ecdsaWalletCreatedCallback` function.

Requirements:
- `activeWalletMainUtxo` components must point to the recent main
UTXO of the given active wallet, as currently known on the

### notifyWalletCloseable

```solidity
function notifyWalletCloseable(bytes20 walletPubKeyHash, struct BitcoinTx.UTXO walletMainUtxo) external
```

Notifies that the wallet is either old enough or has too few
satoshi left and qualifies to be closed.

Requirements:
- Wallet must not be set as the current active wallet,
- Wallet must exceed the wallet maximum age OR the wallet BTC
balance must be lesser than the minimum threshold. If the latter
case is true, the `walletMainUtxo` components must point to the
recent main UTXO of the given wallet, as currently known on the
Ethereum chain. If the wallet has no main UTXO, this parameter
can be empty as it is ignored since the wallet balance is
assumed to be zero,

### submitFraudChallenge

```solidity
function submitFraudChallenge(bytes walletPublicKey, bytes preimageSha256, struct BitcoinTx.RSVSignature signature) external payable
```

Submits a fraud challenge indicating that a UTXO being under
wallet control was unlocked by the wallet but was not used
according to the protocol rules. That means the wallet signed
a transaction input pointing to that UTXO and there is a unique
sighash and signature pair associated with that input. This
function uses those parameters to create a fraud accusation that
proves a given transaction input unlocking the given UTXO was
actually signed by the wallet. This function cannot determine
whether the transaction was actually broadcast and the input was
consumed in a fraudulent way so it just opens a challenge period
during which the wallet can defeat the challenge by submitting
proof of a transaction that consumes the given input according
to protocol rules. To prevent spurious allegations, the caller
must deposit ETH that is returned back upon justified fraud
challenge or confiscated otherwise.

Requirements:
- Wallet behind `walletPublicKey` must be in Live or MovingFunds
or Closing state,
- The challenger must send appropriate amount of ETH used as
fraud challenge deposit,
- The signature (represented by r, s and v) must be generated by
the wallet behind `walletPubKey` during signing of `sighash`
which was calculated from `preimageSha256`,
- Wallet can be challenged for the given signature only once.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| walletPublicKey | bytes | The public key of the wallet in the uncompressed and unprefixed format (64 bytes). |
| preimageSha256 | bytes | The hash that was generated by applying SHA-256 one time over the preimage used during input signing. The preimage is a serialized subset of the transaction and its structure depends on the transaction input (see BIP-143 for reference). Notice that applying SHA-256 over the `preimageSha256` results in `sighash`.  The path from `preimage` to `sighash` looks like this: preimage -> (SHA-256) -> preimageSha256 -> (SHA-256) -> sighash. |
| signature | struct BitcoinTx.RSVSignature | Bitcoin signature in the R/S/V format. |

### defeatFraudChallenge

```solidity
function defeatFraudChallenge(bytes walletPublicKey, bytes preimage, bool witness) external
```

Allows to defeat a pending fraud challenge against a wallet if
the transaction that spends the UTXO follows the protocol rules.
In order to defeat the challenge the same `walletPublicKey` and
signature (represented by `r`, `s` and `v`) must be provided as
were used to calculate the sighash during input signing.
The fraud challenge defeat attempt will only succeed if the
inputs in the preimage are considered honestly spent by the
wallet. Therefore the transaction spending the UTXO must be
proven in the Bridge before a challenge defeat is called.
If successfully defeated, the fraud challenge is marked as
resolved and the amount of ether deposited by the challenger is
sent to the treasury.

Requirements:
- `walletPublicKey` and `sighash` calculated as `hash256(preimage)`
must identify an open fraud challenge,
- the preimage must be a valid preimage of a transaction generated
according to the protocol rules and already proved in the Bridge,
- before a defeat attempt is made the transaction that spends the
given UTXO must be proven in the Bridge.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| walletPublicKey | bytes | The public key of the wallet in the uncompressed and unprefixed format (64 bytes). |
| preimage | bytes | The preimage which produces sighash used to generate the ECDSA signature that is the subject of the fraud claim. It is a serialized subset of the transaction. The exact subset used as the preimage depends on the transaction input the signature is produced for. See BIP-143 for reference. |
| witness | bool | Flag indicating whether the preimage was produced for a witness input. True for witness, false for non-witness input. |

### defeatFraudChallengeWithHeartbeat

```solidity
function defeatFraudChallengeWithHeartbeat(bytes walletPublicKey, bytes heartbeatMessage) external
```

Allows to defeat a pending fraud challenge against a wallet by
proving the sighash and signature were produced for an off-chain
wallet heartbeat message following a strict format.
In order to defeat the challenge the same `walletPublicKey` and
signature (represented by `r`, `s` and `v`) must be provided as
were used to calculate the sighash during heartbeat message
signing. The fraud challenge defeat attempt will only succeed if
the signed message follows a strict format required for
heartbeat messages. If successfully defeated, the fraud
challenge is marked as resolved and the amount of ether
deposited by the challenger is sent to the treasury.

Requirements:
- `walletPublicKey` and `sighash` calculated as
`hash256(heartbeatMessage)` must identify an open fraud challenge,
- `heartbeatMessage` must follow a strict format of heartbeat
messages.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| walletPublicKey | bytes | The public key of the wallet in the uncompressed and unprefixed format (64 bytes). |
| heartbeatMessage | bytes | Off-chain heartbeat message meeting the heartbeat message format requirements which produces sighash used to generate the ECDSA signature that is the subject of the fraud claim. |

### notifyFraudChallengeDefeatTimeout

```solidity
function notifyFraudChallengeDefeatTimeout(bytes walletPublicKey, uint32[] walletMembersIDs, bytes preimageSha256) external
```

Notifies about defeat timeout for the given fraud challenge.
Can be called only if there was a fraud challenge identified by
the provided `walletPublicKey` and `sighash` and it was not
defeated on time. The amount of time that needs to pass after
a fraud challenge is reported is indicated by the
`challengeDefeatTimeout`. After a successful fraud challenge
defeat timeout notification the fraud challenge is marked as
resolved, the stake of each operator is slashed, the ether
deposited is returned to the challenger and the challenger is
rewarded.

Requirements:
- The wallet must be in the Live or MovingFunds or Closing or
Terminated state,
- The `walletPublicKey` and `sighash` calculated from
`preimageSha256` must identify an open fraud challenge,
- The expression `keccak256(abi.encode(walletMembersIDs))` must
be exactly the same as the hash stored under `membersIdsHash`
for the given `walletID`. Those IDs are not directly stored
in the contract for gas efficiency purposes but they can be
read from appropriate `DkgResultSubmitted` and `DkgResultApproved`
events of the `WalletRegistry` contract,
- The amount of time indicated by `challengeDefeatTimeout` must pass
after the challenge was reported.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| walletPublicKey | bytes | The public key of the wallet in the uncompressed and unprefixed format (64 bytes). |
| walletMembersIDs | uint32[] | Identifiers of the wallet signing group members. |
| preimageSha256 | bytes | The hash that was generated by applying SHA-256 one time over the preimage used during input signing. The preimage is a serialized subset of the transaction and its structure depends on the transaction input (see BIP-143 for reference). Notice that applying SHA-256 over the `preimageSha256` results in `sighash`.  The path from `preimage` to `sighash` looks like this: preimage -> (SHA-256) -> preimageSha256 -> (SHA-256) -> sighash. |

### setVaultStatus

```solidity
function setVaultStatus(address vault, bool isTrusted) external
```

Allows the Governance to mark the given vault address as trusted
or no longer trusted. Vaults are not trusted by default.
Trusted vault must meet the following criteria:
- `IVault.receiveBalanceIncrease` must have a known, low gas
cost,
- `IVault.receiveBalanceIncrease` must never revert.

Without restricting reveal only to trusted vaults, malicious
vaults not meeting the criteria would be able to nuke sweep proof
transactions executed by ECDSA wallet with  deposits routed to
them.
Can only be called by the Governance.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| vault | address | The address of the vault. |
| isTrusted | bool | flag indicating whether the vault is trusted or not. |

### setSpvMaintainerStatus

```solidity
function setSpvMaintainerStatus(address spvMaintainer, bool isTrusted) external
```

Allows the Governance to mark the given address as trusted
or no longer trusted SPV maintainer. Addresses are not trusted
as SPV maintainers by default.

The SPV proof does not check whether the transaction is a part of
the Bitcoin mainnet, it only checks whether the transaction has been
mined performing the required amount of work as on Bitcoin mainnet.
The possibility of submitting SPV proofs is limited to trusted SPV
maintainers. The system expects transaction confirmations with the
required work accumulated, so trusted SPV maintainers can not prove
the transaction without providing the required Bitcoin proof of work.
Trusted maintainers address the issue of an economic game between
tBTC and Bitcoin mainnet where large Bitcoin mining pools can decide
to use their hash power to mine fake Bitcoin blocks to prove them in
tBTC instead of receiving Bitcoin miner rewards.
Can only be called by the Governance.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| spvMaintainer | address | The address of the SPV maintainer. |
| isTrusted | bool | flag indicating whether the address is trusted or not. |

### updateDepositParameters

That fee is computed as follows: `treasuryFee = depositedAmount / depositTreasuryFeeDivisor` For example, if the treasury fee needs to be 2% of each deposit, the `depositTreasuryFeeDivisor` should be set to `50` because `1/50 = 0.02 = 2%`. |
| depositTxMaxFee | uint64 | New value of the deposit tx max fee in satoshis. It is the maximum amount of BTC transaction fee that can be incurred by each swept deposit being part of the given sweep transaction. If the maximum BTC transaction fee is exceeded, such transaction is considered a fraud. |

| redemptionTreasuryFeeDivisor | uint64 | New value of the redemption treasury fee divisor. It is the divisor used to compute the treasury fee taken from each redemption request and transferred to the treasury upon successful request finalization. That fee is computed as follows: `treasuryFee = requestedAmount / redemptionTreasuryFeeDivisor` For example, if the treasury fee needs to be 2% of each redemption request, the `redemptionTreasuryFeeDivisor` should be set to `50` because `1/50 = 0.02 = 2%`. |
| redemptionTxMaxFee | uint64 | New value of the redemption transaction max fee in satoshis. It is the maximum amount of BTC transaction fee that can be incurred by each redemption request being part of the given redemption transaction.

### deposits

```solidity
function deposits(uint256 depositKey) external view returns (struct Deposit.DepositRequest)
```

Collection of all revealed deposits indexed by
keccak256(fundingTxHash | fundingOutputIndex).
The fundingTxHash is bytes32 (ordered as in Bitcoin internally)
and fundingOutputIndex an uint32. This mapping may contain valid
and invalid deposits and the wallet is responsible for
validating them before attempting to execute a sweep.

```

Collection of all pending redemption requests indexed by
redemption key built as
`keccak256(keccak256(redeemerOutputScript) | walletPubKeyHash)`.
The walletPubKeyHash is the 20-byte wallet's public key hash
(computed using Bitcoin HASH160 over the compressed ECDSA
public key) and `redeemerOutputScript` is a Bitcoin script
(P2PKH, P2WPKH, P2SH or P2WSH) that will be used to lock
redeemed BTC as requested by the redeemer. Requests are added
to this mapping by the `requestRedemption` method (duplicates
not allowed) and are removed by one of the following methods:
- `submitRedemptionProof` in case the request was handled
successfully,
- `notifyRedemptionTimeout` in case the request was reported
to be timed out.

### timedOutRedemptions

The walletPubKeyHash is the 20-byte wallet's public key hash
(computed using Bitcoin HASH160 over the compressed ECDSA
public key) and `redeemerOutputScript` is the Bitcoin script
(P2PKH, P2WPKH, P2SH or P2WSH) that is involved in the timed
out request.
Only one method can add to this mapping:
- `notifyRedemptionTimeout` which puts the redemption key
to this mapping based on a timed out request stored
previously in `pendingRedemptions` mapping.
Only one method can remove entries from this mapping:
- `submitRedemptionProof` in case the timed out redemption
request was a part of the proven transaction.

### isVaultTrusted

```solidity
function isVaultTrusted(address vault) external view returns (bool)
```

Indicates if the vault with the given address is trusted or not.
Depositors can route their revealed deposits only to trusted
vaults and have trusted vaults notified about new deposits as
soon as these deposits get swept. Vaults not trusted by the
Bridge can still be used by Bank balance owners on their own
responsibility - anyone can approve their Bank balance to any
address.

### depositParameters

```solidity
function depositParameters() external view returns (uint64 depositDustThreshold, uint64 depositTreasuryFeeDivisor, uint64 depositTxMaxFee, uint32 depositRevealAheadPeriod)
```

Returns the current values of Bridge deposit parameters.

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| depositDustThreshold | uint64 | The minimal amount that can be requested to deposit. Value of this parameter must take into account the value of `depositTreasuryFeeDivisor` and `depositTxMaxFee` parameters in order to make requests that can incur the treasury and transaction fee and still satisfy the depositor. |
| depositTreasuryFeeDivisor | uint64 | Divisor used to compute the treasury fee taken from each deposit and transferred to the treasury upon sweep proof submission. That fee is computed as follows: `treasuryFee = depositedAmount / depositTreasuryFeeDivisor` For example, if the treasury fee needs to be 2% of each deposit, the `depositTreasuryFeeDivisor` should be set to `50` because `1/50 = 0.02 = 2%`. |
| depositTxMaxFee | uint64 | Maximum amount of BTC transaction fee that can be incurred by each swept deposit being part of the given sweep transaction. If the maximum BTC transaction fee is exceeded, such transaction is considered a fraud. |
| depositRevealAheadPeriod | uint32 | Defines the length of the period that must be preserved between the deposit reveal time and the deposit refund locktime. For example, if the deposit become refundable on August 1st, and the ahead period is 7 days, the latest moment for deposit reveal is July 25th. Value in seconds. |

### redemptionParameters

```solidity

```

Returns the current values of Bridge redemption parameters.

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| redemptionDustThreshold | uint64 | The minimal amount that can be requested for redemption. Value of this parameter must take into account the value of `redemptionTreasuryFeeDivisor` and `redemptionTxMaxFee` parameters in order to make requests that can incur the treasury and transaction fee and still satisfy the redeemer. |
| redemptionTreasuryFeeDivisor | uint64 | Divisor used to compute the treasury fee taken from each redemption request and transferred to the treasury upon successful request finalization. That fee is computed as follows: `treasuryFee = requestedAmount / redemptionTreasuryFeeDivisor` For example, if the treasury fee needs to be 2% of each redemption request, the `redemptionTreasuryFeeDivisor` should be set to `50` because `1/50 = 0.02 = 2%`. |
| redemptionTxMaxFee | uint64 | Maximum amount of BTC transaction fee that can be incurred by each redemption request being part of the given redemption transaction. If the maximum BTC transaction fee is exceeded, such transaction is considered a fraud. This is a per-redemption output max fee for the redemption transaction. |
| redemptionTxMaxTotalFee | uint64 | Maximum amount of the total BTC transaction fee that is acceptable in a single redemption transaction. This is a _total_ max fee for the entire redemption transaction. |
| redemptionTimeout | uint32 | Time after which the redemption request can be reported as timed out. It is counted from the moment when the redemption request was created via `requestRedemption` call. Reported  timed out requests are cancelled and locked balance is returned to the redeemer in full amount. |
| redemptionTimeoutSlashingAmount | uint96 | The amount of stake slashed from each member of a wallet for a redemption timeout. |
| redemptionTimeoutNotifierRewardMultiplier | uint32 | The percentage of the notifier reward from the staking contract the notifier of a redemption timeout receives. The value is in the range [0, 100]. |

| movingFundsDustThreshold | uint64 | The minimal satoshi amount that makes sense to be transferred during the moving funds process. Moving funds wallets having their BTC balance below that value can begin closing immediately as transferring such a low value may not be possible due to BTC network fees. |
| movingFundsTimeoutResetDelay | uint32 | Time after which the moving funds timeout can be reset in case the target wallet commitment cannot be submitted due to a lack of live wallets in the system. It is counted from the moment when the wallet was requested to move their funds and switched to the MovingFunds state or from the moment the timeout was reset the last time. Value in seconds This value should be lower than the value of the `movingFundsTimeout`. |
