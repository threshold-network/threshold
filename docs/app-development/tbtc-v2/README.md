# tBTC

[tBTC](../../threshold-dashboard/tbtc-minting-walkthrough.md) is a decentralized and permissionless onchain representation of Bitcoin, developed by Threshold Network, designed to make Bitcoin (BTC) usable across Ethereum, non-EVM chains, other major blockchain ecosystems, and  institutional financial markets.

Each tBTC is fully backed 1:1 by native Bitcoin and secured through a decentralized network of independent node operators using threshold cryptography, eliminating reliance on any centralized custodian. This allows Bitcoin holders to access liquidity, yield, and markets across multiple chains while maintaining full control of their BTC.

With its institutional-grade security model, rotating signer set, and transparent onchain operations, tBTC provides a secure, compliant, and trust-minimized foundation for developers and institutions seeking to build or deploy Bitcoin-based applications.

**By integrating tBTC through the available SDKs and developer resources,** projects can seamlessly connect Bitcoin liquidity to both EVM and non-EVM environments, unlocking new opportunities in decentralized finance and cross-chain interoperability.\
