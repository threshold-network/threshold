# Staked Token Delegation

Stakers on Threshold can delegate their stake weights to themselves or a third party for voting on governance proposals.

{% hint style="info" %}
Delegation is accomplished via an on-chain transaction which costs ETH gas.
{% endhint %}

1. Go to [https://stake.nucypher.network/manage/delegate](https://stake.nucypher.network/manage/delegate)

2\. Connect your wallet

3\. Enter the delegate address - once an address is entered, a _“Delegate”_ button will appear
