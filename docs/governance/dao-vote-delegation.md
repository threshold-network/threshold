# Vote Delegation

To participate in DAO governance, token holders must set a governance delegate address. Vote delegation is the process of granting a delegate the power to vote on your behalf, using your voting weight, on DAO governance issues. The delegate can be yourself (self-delegation) or a third party. A configured delegate can be changed or revoked at any time.

Delegation **never involves the transfer of custody of assets** but rather just the vote weight those assets represent in the Threshold DAO.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Third-Party Delegation

Third-party delegates are volunteers who actively participate in Threshold governance and wish to grow their influence over critical DAO decisions. Delegates provide ETH addresses to which other Threshold token holders and Threshold stakers can delegate their vote weight. Third-party delegates are subsequently responsible for voting on Threshold governance proposals with this vote weight that others have assigned to them.

Community members who are unsure or uninterested in governance and do not want to actively participate in proposals, discussions, and voting, can instead delegate to active DAO members who have demonstrated a commitment to Threshold. Delegating their vote allows token holders and stakers to have an indirect say in the DAO without being involved in day-to-day governance activities.

Community members interested in serving as delegates can self-nominate [here](https://forum.threshold.network/t/threshold-dao-delegates/325).

{% hint style="info" %}
There is no compensation for third-party delegate contribution to governance.

The process for delegating [liquid tokens](token-weight-delegation.md) is explained in the following subsection. It's not currently possible to delegate tokens deposited as LP in AMM pools (e.g. Curve), although this is an area for future improvement.
