## Before you start

Here are some things you will need before you start the minting process:\
\
**What you need:**

:white\_check\_mark: At least 0.01 Bitcoin (BTC)

:white\_check\_mark: Bitcoin compatible wallet (self-custodied)

:white\_check\_mark: Destination Wallet (on supported chains; see the list of supported chains [here](https://docs.threshold.network/contract-addresses/tbtc).)\
\
**Important Reminders:**

* _Always download and securely store your deposit receipt._ This JSON file is required to recover your funds in the event of any technical issues during the minting process.&#x20;
* _Minting may take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours_, depending on the amount of BTC deposited. You can monitor the status at [https://tbtcscan.com](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description\&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbUotT2RIcktaUHQ1aUp3d01ud19JNVdxdFpDd3xBQ3Jtc0tuQWVTbmpfM3RyUU5NaDJmNzlQSG5oSDk5V0FZSEhPWlVCbE5ESGw2OG9GNjZzVkVzRUE2bF8ybkxEckZlRUw1MkU1T0JUZEtpaGlGdlg2ZUVfR3VtQWxpVnFmbVFoQVVLbm1mTWhGalNSdmNKTUcxRQ\&q=https%3A%2F%2Ftbtcscan.com%2F\&v=_2nUqzd83gI).&#x20;
* _Your BTC recovery address must come from a self-custodied wallet that you control._ Do not use an address from a centralized exchange. &#x20;
* _Multisig wallets are supported as long as they’re on the correct network._

If you don't have a Bitcoin wallet, you'll need to set one up. A solid option to use is Green Wallet. You can download it here:

* [Apple store download](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/green-bitcoin-wallet/id1402243590)
* [Google store download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greenaddress.greenbits_android_wallet\&gl=US\&pli=1)

After you've created your wallet, select `Bitcoin` as your network..

If you have questions about terminology, you can toggle over to the **How it Works** page in the dapp to learn more. You can also dive into documentation on [wallet generation](https://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2/wallet-generation) and [bridge permissionlessness](https://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2/the-path-to-permissionlessness) in the docs.
