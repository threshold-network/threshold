# T Token

The [T token](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCdF7028ceAB81fA0C6971208e83fa7872994beE5) is an ERC-20 work token for the Threshold Network that serves several functions. It is the networkâ€™s proof of stake token, which helps secure the Threshold Network, and it is also the governance token for the [Threshold DAO](../governance/dao/), which allows the community to make [collective decisions](../governance/dao/governance-process.md) about the network.

### Genesis

* 4.5B T allocated to NU token holders&#x20;
* 4.5B T allocated to KEEP token holders&#x20;
* 1B T allocated to the Threshold DAO treasury
