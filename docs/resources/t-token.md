# T Token

The [T token](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCdF7028ceAB81fA0C6971208e83fa7872994beE5) is an ERC-20 work token for the Threshold Network that serves several functions. It is the network’s proof of stake token, which helps secure the Threshold Network, and it is also the governance token for the [Threshold DAO](../governance/dao/), which allows the community to make [collective decisions](../governance/dao/governance-process.md) about the network.

### Genesis

The initial supply of T was established by the DAO [at launch](https://blog.threshold.network/threshold-launch/) as 10B T with the following allocation:&#x20;

* 4.5B T allocated to NU token holders&#x20;
* 4.5B T allocated to KEEP token holders&#x20;
* 1B T allocated to the Threshold DAO treasury

### Cross-Chain Presence

The T token is designed to be network-agnostic, allowing it to move seamlessly across multiple blockchains. This multi-chain approach broadens T’s reach in DeFi, improves liquidity and helps ensure a more robust ecosystem. Below are the current official contract addresses for T token on each supported chain:
