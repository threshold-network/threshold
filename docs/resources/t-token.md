# T Token

The [T token](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCdF7028ceAB81fA0C6971208e83fa7872994beE5) is an ERC-20 token that powers tBTC and serves as the value accrual asset for the Threshold Network.. It is also the governance token for the [Threshold DAO](broken-reference), which allows the community to make [collective decisions](../governance/governance-process.md) about the network.

### Supply

The initial supply of T was established by the DAO [at launch](https://blog.threshold.network/threshold-launch/) as 10B T with the following allocation:&#x20;

* 4.5B T allocated to NU token holders&#x20;
* 4.5B T allocated to KEEP token holders&#x20;
* 1B T allocated to the Threshold DAO treasury

An additional 1.155B tokens were minted during the network's inflationary bootstraping phase as incentives for stakers and node operators, resulting in a final total supply of 11,155,000,000 T tokens.

### Cross-Chain Presence

The T token is designed to be network-agnostic, allowing it to move seamlessly across multiple blockchains. This multi-chain approach broadens T’s reach in DeFi, improves liquidity and helps ensure a more robust ecosystem. Below are the current official contract addresses for T token on each supported chain:
