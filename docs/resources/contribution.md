# Contribution

### Overview

The Threshold DAO is an inclusive environment that welcomes new contributors. There are many ways to get involved. The DAO is composed of three parts: Token Holder DAO, Threshold Council, and Guilds.

* **Token Holder DAO** consists of T token holders who govern Threshold Network and elect positions for Threshold Council and Guild Committees.
* **Threshold Council** oversees staker rewards splits/distributions and executes multi-sig transactions on behalf of the DAO when applicable.
* **Treasury Guild** manages the Threshold DAO treasury. This includes growing Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL), researching / implementing best practice treasury management strategies, executing ecosystem liquidity incentives, diversifying the treasury and more.
* **Marketing Guild** is responsible for marketing across channels, growing contributor network, on-boarding new members to the Threshold DAO, and educating people about Threshold’s value, services and use cases.
* **Integrations Guild** operates with a mission to build successful, synergistic and long-lasting relationships with other protocols, DAOs and external organizations.\

#### Participate in governance

Any T token holder is welcome to participate in the active Threshold governance ecosystem by joining the proposal discussion on our forums or by joining snapshots on on-chain governance decisions. In addition, the DAO actively welcomes new proposals.&#x20;

This means if you have an idea to improve the Threshold ecosystem, it’s possible to write a proposal and request funding from the DAO. A great example for such a community initiative is [thUSD](https://docs.threshold.network/applications/threshold-usd), the upcoming DAO-operated stable coin.
