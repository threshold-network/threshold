# Staking on Threshold

Stakes on Threshold can take the following forms:

* T stake using liquid T created on the [Threshold Dashboard](https://dashboard.threshold.network/staking)
* Legacy NU stake migrated to T from the [NuCypher Dashboard](https://stake.nucypher.network/manage)
* Legacy KEEP stake migrated to T from the [Keep Dashboard](https://dashboard.keep.network/applications/threshold)

Here is a summary of the overall process:
