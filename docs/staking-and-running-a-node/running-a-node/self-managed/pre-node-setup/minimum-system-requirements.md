# Minimum System Requirements

TACo nodes are very light and can be run inexpensively, on a remote instance or local machine. Specs similar to (or greater) than the following will suffice: &#x20;

* **Debian** or **Ubuntu** (recommended distributions)
* **20GB** storage
* **4GB** RAM
* **x86** architecture
* Static IP address
* Exposed TCP port **9151**

TACo can be run on cloud infrastructure. For example, a Digital Ocean [4GB Basic Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets) satisfies the requirements listed above. See [Cloud Setup](installation/cloud-setup-nucypher-ops.md) for an Ansible script that automates some of the node setup and configuration.&#x20;
