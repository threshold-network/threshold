# Duties & Compensation

### Node **Operator Duties**&#x20;

Running a TACo node is not a passive activity, but the on-going responsibilities for stakers are very manageable. To supply a high quality service and sustain the utility of the Threshold Network, TACo node operators must:&#x20;

* Keep the server/machine running TACo online and accessible at all times; such that incoming decryption requests are verified and answered immediately, and there is no delay in reaching a threshold and supplying decryption material to qualifying data recipients.&#x20;
* Ensure their machine is running the latest version of TACo. New version releases will be shared on the Threshold Discord [#announcements](https://discord.com/channels/866378471868727316/870384195636199455) channel – make sure you have notifications enabled. Installing software upgrades is straightforward using [nucypher-ops](broken-reference).

### **Deauthorization Delay**&#x20;

Adopters of TACo require reassurance that the cohorts of nodes managing their users' data will remain intact for extended durations. Although cohort members can be securely replaced, while maintaining a persistent public key, it is preferable for economic reasons to minimize the number of node replacement rituals – particularly in the genesis era of the service. Hence, TACo service provision ideally involves a commitment to provide service for years, rather than months.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
The _deauthorization dela_y is the time one must wait between initiating a withdrawal from TACo service provision and being able to complete that withdrawal.\
\
From genesis, the deauthorization delay is set to **6 months** (183 days).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Note that this delay is universal and independent of any other token lock-up or bonus mechanism.&#x20;

### **Fees**&#x20;

The first version of TACo will launch with fee-paying adopters. They will each pay a duration-based fee upfront, which gets them 6 months of access to the TACo API and a corresponding cohort of nodes to manage access to their users' data. These fees are paid in **DAI**.&#x20;

Fees will be collected and held by the Coordinator contract, which will be temporarily placed under the control of the Threshold Council.&#x20;

Following a set of competing proposals and votes, the DAO will choose a fee distribution mechanism, which will use the accumulated fees in a way that is most beneficial to the network and participating stakers. Here are some ideas to consider ahead of this collective decision:&#x20;

* Should fees be automatically converted to T, which would support the Threshold token price, enable compensation in a single token, and increase protocol-owned liquidity?
* Should stakers whose node is a member of more cohorts be compensated with commensurate fees, or should fees be distributed based purely on availability (i.e. stand-by nodes earn the same as nodes in active cohorts)?&#x20;

### **Rewards**&#x20;

TACo node operators will earn **3.75%** APY from launch. This yield is maintained, irrespective of the fluctuations to the staking rate, by the [Stable Yield](https://forum.threshold.network/t/tip-003-threshold-network-reward-mechanisms-proposal-i-stable-yield-for-non-institutional-staker-welfare/82) mechanism. \`

Please note that once TACo launches, stakers will not earn any yield if they only run a Proxy Re-Encryption node. PRE is being folded into the TACo application. &#x20;
