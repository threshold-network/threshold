# One-off Commitment Bonus

To incentivize longer commitments at genesis, stakers can choose extended token lock-up periods and receive a commensurate bonus. This deadline to commit to a token lock-up is January 15th, 2024 (UTC 00:00).&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that once you commit to a token lock-up extension, you cannot go back and edit it, even before the deadline.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Stakers can choose from four extension durations: \
\
**9** months minimum = **0.5%** extra yield\
(6 month obligatory deauthorization delay + 3 month voluntary extension)

**12** months minimum  = **1%** extra yield\
(6m delay + 6m extension)&#x20;

**18** months minimum = **2%** extra yield\
(6m delay + 12m extension)&#x20;

**24** months minimum = **3%** extra yield\
(6m delay + 18m extension)&#x20;

These bonus figures have been [validated](https://snapshot.org/#/threshold.eth/proposal/0x868139f4c9769e2ebd779b0a94558bf8f424c790dfdb68506b5f8b67442ce768) by the Threshold DAO.

TACo’s _deauthorization delay_ is the time one must wait between initiating a withdrawal from TACo service provision and being able to complete that withdrawal – is set to 6 months (**182 days**). This delay is the universal default and is entirely independent from the bonus mechanism. Stakers who choose a lock-up extension duration for the one-off bonus may only initiate the deauthorization delay _once the bonus lock-up extension period has elapsed_.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Stakers will continue to earn TACo rewards (3.75% annual yield) after initiating the deauthorization delay, until the moment they withdraw their stake.
{% endhint %}

Note that the bonus is a _one-off_ incentive mechanism. Stakers cannot change the lock-up duration once they have clicked **Commit to Token Lock-up** in the staking dashboard. Stakers who authorize more tokens to TACo before the deadline will see those tokens locked up for the same duration as that they've already committed to, and their bonus sum increase correspondingly.&#x20;

The bonus will be withdrawable on February 1st – i.e. stakers will not have to wait for their stake to unlock.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
After the bonus deadline of January 15th 2024, top-ups to one’s stake will not count towards increasing the bonus sum (this will have already been calculated and minted), but **top-ups will be subject to the same unlock horizon**. In other words, you cannot create multiple stake tranches that unlock at different times. Please choose your bonus extension duration very carefully.&#x20;
