# TACo Node Setup

**Running your own TACo node is not a passive activity, but the set-up and on-going responsibilities are very manageable for independent stakers.**&#x20;

Before authorizing your stake to TACo, please read all the pages in this section to understand the system requirements, installation options, operator responsibilities, token lock-up commitments, and reward/fee models.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
As of January 1st 2024, running a Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE) node is no longer compensated by Threshold's inflationary rewards (Stable Yield). Stakers are advised to shut down their PRE server and spin up a TACo node on a fresh instance if they wish to continue earning a 3.75% yield. PRE functionality will be folded into a later version of the TACo service, if and when there is demand from adopting developers.&#x20;
