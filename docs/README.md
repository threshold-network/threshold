# What is the Threshold Network?

**Threshold Network powers tBTC, the Bitcoin standard in finance, and the most decentralized 1:1 tokenized Bitcoin.**

tBTC enables Bitcoin liquidity to move seamlessly across chains without compromising settlement finality. Built on threshold cryptography and secured by a rotating network of independent node operators, it distributes control of Bitcoin so that no single entity can act alone on funds.&#x20;

This structure upholds Bitcoin’s core principles of being trust-minimized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant while maintaining a direct and verifiable path back to native Bitcoin. No complex staking mechanics needed.

Threshold Network's [T token](t-token.md) is the value accrual and governance asset for the network.
