# What is the Threshold Network?

Threshold Network powers tBTC, the Bitcoin standard for DeFi—a trust-minimized way to bring BTC liquidity into the crypto ecosystem while always maintaining a direct settlement path back to native Bitcoin.

Unlike other BTC derivatives or wrapped tokens, tBTC is designed to be as close to Bitcoin as possible while enabling seamless participation in DeFi. No complex staking mechanics, no dependency on a single entity—just pure BTC liquidity that always settles back to Bitcoin.

Threshold Network's [T token](resources/t-token.md) powers tBTC and is the value accrual asset used to distribute profits from bridge fee via token buybacks.&#x20;
