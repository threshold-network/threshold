# What is the Threshold Network?

As decentralized apps become the digital norm, Web 3.0 platforms will increasingly face the challenge of guaranteeing user privacy and sovereignty when interacting on public blockchains.&#x20;

The Threshold Network remedies these concerns by offering a full suite of decentralized threshold cryptography services. Threshold cryptography protects data by distributing operations across a network of independent nodes. This simple idea increases security and availability and reduces reliance on trusted parties.

Threshold, and its [T token](resources/t-token.md), allow token holders can help power a one-stop platform for threshold cryptographic services by staking and running a decentralized node, and are incentivized to provide these services without any central authority.&#x20;

At the heart of the Threshold Network are flagship services like [tBTC](applications/tbtc-v2/), a bitcoin asset bridge, and  [TACo](applications/threshold-access-control/), an access control plugin. Traditionally, critical operations such as signing, randomness generation, and access control require trust in a single entity.

However, on the Threshold Network, these functionalities are decentralized and trust-minimized, ensuring robust security and integrity.

As the blockchain revolution continues, the community-driven Threshold Network will provide a growing set of cryptographic tools to power the privacy-focused and self-sovereign decentralized future.&#x20;

With the Threshold Network, the future of decentralized security is here.
