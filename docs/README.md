As decentralized apps become the digital norm, Web 3.0 platforms will increasingly face the challenge of guaranteeing user privacy and sovereignty when interacting on public blockchains.&#x20;

The Threshold Network remedies these concerns by offering a full suite of decentralized threshold cryptography services. Threshold cryptography protects data by distributing operations across a network of independent nodes.&#x20;

Threshold, and its T token, merges Keep Network’s ability to secure private data through off-chain containers and NuCypher’s privacy tools for secrets management and dynamic access control.&#x20;

Token holders can help power a one-stop platform for threshold cryptographic services by staking and running a decentralized node, and are incentivized to provide these services without any central authority.&#x20;

For developers, the use cases are near endless: if you need to share private data in a scalable and trustless way—such as transferring access or rights to a digital asset that is dynamically controlled by a smart contract —you can use Threshold’s proxy re-encryption services; or if you need to create a digital asset bridge that maintains user sovereignty without the need for a centralized custodian you can leverage Threshold’s decentralized and secure off-chain containers.&#x20;

As the blockchain revolution continues, the community-driven Threshold Network will provide a growing set of cryptographic tools to power the privacy-focused and self-sovereign decentralized future.
