**Good to know:** providing a brief overview of your product and its core use cases is a great place to start with product docs. Your product might seem obvious to you – you made it! However, to others, even folks who are trying your product after reading your site or getting a sales demo, it can still be unclear. This is your chance to clarify your product and set the right expectations!

Here are a couple of examples of succinct overviews from products with really great docs:

> Loom is a video messaging tool that helps you get your message across through instantly shareable videos.
>
> With Loom, you can record your camera, microphone, and desktop simultaneously. Your video is then instantly available to share through Loom's patented technology.

> The Mailchimp Marketing API provides programmatic access to Mailchimp data and functionality, allowing developers to build custom features to do things like sync email activity and campaign analytics with their database, manage audiences and campaigns, and more.
